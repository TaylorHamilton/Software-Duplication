    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>Software duplication is when a code occurs more then once within the program or across other programs</p>

    <h2>How does Software Duplication affect coding</h2>
    <p>Software duplication can lead to negative impacts in software development and maintenance. It can lead to an increase in bug occurrences. More software means that there is more required maintenance effort, and the software quality/performance can go down. 
    </p>

    <h3>How do people fight against it?
    </h3>
    <p>Lots of people are using different applications to prevent from their code being duplicated.
    </p>

    <h4>Types of Software Duplication</h4>
    <p>Basic Literal Duplication
    this happens when sections of code are completely identical this is  mostly due to copy-and-paste programming
    Structural Duplication
    When the overall pattern of some code is the same, but details differ from loop to loop
    Temporal Duplication
    When the code only appears once in the source code, but the effect is repeated when executed
    Duplication of Intent
    When in a large project and one person writes some code in a source file to do something and another writes some code to do the same thing in another source file
    </p>

    <h5>Four Facts
    </h5>
    <p>Fixing it can be expensive sometimes.
        You can detect duplicate code by Bakers algorithm. 
        Copying or pasting can duplicate code.
        In the past duplicate code would take up the space in codes due to the limited amount of space.
